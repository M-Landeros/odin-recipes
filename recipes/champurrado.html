            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Champurrado is a thick, warm, and sweet Mexican chocolate drink that's a type of atole, a sweet, warm Mexican drink made with a masa harina base. It's often made with Mexican chocolate, piloncillo (Mexican brown sugar), and masa de maiz, masa harina, or corn flour. Other ingredients that can be added include cinnamon, anise seed, vanilla, ground nuts, orange zest, and egg. Champurrado has a richer, grainier consistency than atole, which is made with cornstarch for a smoother, creamier texture
